This project encompasses several key tasks aimed at developing a machine learning model and deploying it as a user-friendly web application for predicting the resale prices of flats in Singapore. The step-by-step breakdown of the project involves:

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:
  Collect a comprehensive dataset of resale flat transactions from the Singapore Housing and Development Board (HDB) spanning the years 1990 to the present day.
  Preprocess the collected data to ensure cleanliness and structure, making it suitable for machine learning applications.

2. Feature Engineering:
  Extract relevant features from the dataset, including town, flat type, storey range, floor area, flat model, and lease commence date.
  Introduce any additional features deemed beneficial for enhancing prediction accuracy.

3. Model Selection and Training:
  Chose an appropriate machine learning regression model i.e random forests.
  Train the selected model using historical data, reserving a portion of the dataset for training purposes.

4. Model Evaluation:
  Assess the predictive performance of the trained model using regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R2 Score.

5. Streamlit Web Application:
  Develop a user-friendly web application using Streamlit.
  Enable users to input details of a flat (town, flat type, storey range, etc.) and leverage the trained machine learning model to predict resale prices based on user inputs.

6. Deployment on Render:
  Deploy the Streamlit application on the Render platform to make it easily accessible to users over the internet.

7. Testing and Validation:
  Conduct thorough testing of the deployed application to ensure its correct functionality and the provision of accurate predictions.
  
This comprehensive approach ensures the creation of an effective and reliable tool for assisting both potential buyers and sellers in estimating the resale value of flats in Singapore.
